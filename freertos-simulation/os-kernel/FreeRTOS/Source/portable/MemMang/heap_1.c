/**
 * This is the simplest implementation of all. It does not permit memory to be
 * freed once it has been allocated. Despite this, heap_1.c is appropriate for
 * a large number of embedded applications. This is because many small and deeply
 * embedded applications create all the tasks, queues, semaphores, etc. required
 * when the system boots, and then use all of these objects for the lifetime of
 * program (until the application is switched off again, or is rebooted). Nothing
 * ever gets deleted.
 *
 * The implementation simply subdivides a single array into smaller blocks as RAM
 * is requested. The total size of the array (the total size of the heap) is set
 * by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE â€“ which is defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h.
 * The configAPPLICATION_ALLOCATED_HEAP FreeRTOSConfig.h configuration constant is
 * provided to allow the heap to be placed at a specific address in memory.
 *
 * The xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function returns the total amount of heap space
 * that remains unallocated, allowing the configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE setting to be optimised.
 *
 * The heap_1 implementation:
 * Can be used if your application never deletes a task, queue, semaphore, mutex, etc.
 * (which actually covers the majority of applications in which FreeRTOS gets used).
 * Is always deterministic (always takes the same amount of time to execute) and cannot
 * result in memory fragmentation. Is very simple and allocated memory from a statically
 * allocated array, meaning it is often suitable for use in applications that do not permit
 * true dynamic memory allocation.
 */

/*
 * The simplest possible implementation of pvPortMalloc().  Note that this
 * implementation does NOT allow allocated memory to be freed again.
 *
 * See heap_2.c and heap_3.c for alternative implementations, and the memory
 * management pages of http://www.FreeRTOS.org for more information.
